            <h2>Hi there! My name is Ryan and this is my learning Blog</h2>
            <p> After nearly a year of trying to learn on my own
                I decided to buy a yearly subscription to Scrimba to learn
                at a better pace.

        <h1>My New journey as a bootcamp student.</h1>
        <p>
          After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
          Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code
          reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

        <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
        <p>
          I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
          and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
          learned or work new techniques into existing projects. While that was
          fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and
          most things about my journey with the world.
        </p>
        <h2>
          How I got started I started simple and gradually grew my learning
          journal site.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning
          session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but
          also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words. That
          helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my
          learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
